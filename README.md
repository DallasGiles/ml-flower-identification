In the follwing module the test takes info from a dataset in sklearn called load_iris. It has flowers and characteristics. We take the data and create an 80:20 split with training:testing, we generate a random flower using random uniform in numpy. we train the model in a forest with 100 trees and a random factor of 42 to ensure replicable results. We compare the results of our test and our prediction to come up with an accuracy score. We print the accuracy score then move on to predictin the species of the flower. Then we print it to the screen along with what we printed as the accuracy score.

Now has a feature that displays a bar graph based on how important each feature is to the model and what weight it holds in calculating and predicting which flower it is.
